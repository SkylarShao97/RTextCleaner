# formulate image segmentation in a supervised setting with tensor networks. The
# key idea is to first lift the pixels in image patches to exponentially high
# dimensional feature spaces and using a linear decision hyper-plane to classify
# the input pixels into foreground and background classes. The high dimensional
# linear model itself is approximated using the matrix product state (MPS) tensor
# network. The MPS is weight-shared between the non-overlapping image patches
# resulting in our strided tensor network model. The performance of the proposed
# model is evaluated on three 2D- and one 3D- biomedical imaging datasets. The
# performance of the proposed tensor network segmentation model is compared with
# relevant baseline methods. In the 2D experiments, the tensor network model
# yeilds competitive performance compared to the baseline methods while being
# more resource efficient.")
